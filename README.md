## Masters Degree Thesis
My masters degree thesis studies how 1) city/state political leaning affect CO2 emissions per capita and 2) city/state political leaning affect support for federal climate legislation. It also compares the differences found between cities and states to discuss environmental policy within the scope of US federalism.

## What technologies I used
I used Python's pandas for preprocessing 8 datasets. I also set up 2 webscrapers using BS4 and URLLIB. For visualizations I used Python's Seaborn and Matplotlib. I then used Python's statistical and ML frameworks, statsmodel and sklearn, for my analysis. In my analysis I used Linear and Logistic Regression.

## Findings
My paper will be published soon by the University Library. I will provide a link when it is ready. 

Here is the abstract of the paper:

ABSTRACT
This study considers how political leaning correlates with CO2 emissions per capita and support for the Paris Climate Agreement at the city vs state level the United States. The study was conducted using quantitative analysis and used all 50 states and 52 cities with population over 250,000 in the US for analysis. It was found that both left leaning states and left leaning cities were more likely to support the Paris Climate Agreement, though this likelihood was stronger for states than it was for cities. Additionally, it was found that left leaning states tended to have lower CO2 emissions per capita than right leaning states while there was no relationship between political leaning and CO2 emissions per capita for cities.
