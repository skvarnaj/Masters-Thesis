## Masters Degree Thesis
My masters degree thesis studies what political characteristics of cities lead to lower CO2 emissions per capita (specifically political party of mayor/governor, citizen partisanship leaning, and governor/mayoral support for Paris climate agreement). And secondarily, how citizen partisan leaning influences support for Paris climate agreement on a state vs city level.

## What technologies I used
I used Python's pandas for preprocessing 8 datasets. I also set up 2 webscrapers using BS4 and URLLIB. I then used Python's ML frameworks, statsmodel and sklearn, for my analysis. In my analysis I used Linear and Logistic Regression.

## Findings
I have written a full draft of the thesis, but have not submitted it to the University library for publication or have defended it yet. I will share my findings when this process is complete. A summary of my findings and a link to the full paper will be made available soon.
